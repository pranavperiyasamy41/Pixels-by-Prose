# Pixels by Prose

**Transform your words into stunning cartoon-style images using AI**

Pixels by Prose is a text-to-image generation application that converts text prompts into artistic cartoon-style images using the Arcane Diffusion model. Built with Gradio and Stable Diffusion, this project demonstrates the power of AI in creative visual generation.

## Features

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Convert any text description into a cartoon-style images
- **Arcane Diffusion Model**: Utilizes the specialized Arcane-Diffusion model for unique artistic outputs
- **Simple Web Interface**: Clean and intuitive interface powered by Gradio
- **GPU Accelerated**: Optimized for CUDA-enabled devices for fast generation
- **One-Click Generation**: Just enter your prompt and generate instantly

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**: Core programming language
- **Gradio**: Web interface framework for ML applications
- **Diffusers**: Hugging Face library for diffusion models
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework with CUDA support
- **Stable Diffusion**: Base architecture for image generation
- **Arcane Diffusion Model**: Pre-trained model from nitrosocke for cartoon-style images
